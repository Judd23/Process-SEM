Warning messages:
1: lavaan->lav_model_vcov():  
   The variance-covariance matrix of the estimated parameters (vcov) does not 
   appear to be positive definite! The smallest eigenvalue (= 1.435300e-15) 
   is close to zero. This may be a symptom that the model is not identified. 
2: lavaan->lav_model_vcov():  
   The variance-covariance matrix of the estimated parameters (vcov) does not 
   appear to be positive definite! The smallest eigenvalue (= 3.743215e-16) 
   is close to zero. This may be a symptom that the model is not identified. 
3: lavaan->lav_model_vcov():  
   The variance-covariance matrix of the estimated parameters (vcov) does not 
   appear to be positive definite! The smallest eigenvalue (= 6.418254e-16) 
   is close to zero. This may be a symptom that the model is not identified. 
4: lavaan->lav_model_vcov():  
   The variance-covariance matrix of the estimated parameters (vcov) does not 
   appear to be positive definite! The smallest eigenvalue (= 4.003592e-16) 
   is close to zero. This may be a symptom that the model is not identified. 
5: lavaan->lav_model_vcov():  
   The variance-covariance matrix of the estimated parameters (vcov) does not 
   appear to be positive definite! The smallest eigenvalue (= 6.755021e-16) 
   is close to zero. This may be a symptom that the model is not identified. 
6: lavaan->lav_object_post_check():  
   some estimated ov variances are negative
