<h2
id="psychosocial-effects-of-accelerated-dual-credit-on-first-year-developmental-adjustment">Psychosocial
Effects of Accelerated Dual Credit on First-Year Developmental
Adjustment</h2>
<p><strong>Analysis Date</strong>: January 1, 2026<br />
<strong>Sample Size</strong>: N = 5,000 students<br />
<strong>Statistical Method</strong>: Structural Equation Modeling with
Propensity Score Weighting</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This study examined whether students who enter college with
significant dual credit experience (“FASt” students—those with 12 or
more transferable credits at matriculation) differ in their first-year
developmental adjustment compared to their peers. The analysis tested
whether any effects operate through two psychological mechanisms:
emotional distress and quality of engagement with the campus
community.</p>
<hr />
<h2
id="research-question-1-does-fast-status-affect-developmental-adjustment">Research
Question 1: Does FASt Status Affect Developmental Adjustment?</h2>
<p><strong>Finding: Yes, but the effect depends on how many credits
students bring.</strong></p>
<p>At the average level of credit accumulation, FASt students show
significantly lower developmental adjustment compared to non-FASt peers.
The total effect is -0.045 (p = .012), meaning FASt students score about
4.5% of a standard deviation lower on developmental adjustment.</p>
<p>However, this effect varies considerably based on credit dose (the
number of credits students accumulated): - <strong>Students with fewer
credits</strong> (1 SD below average): No significant difference from
non-FASt peers - <strong>Students with average credits</strong>:
Significant negative effect on adjustment - <strong>Students with more
credits</strong> (1 SD above average): Larger negative effect (-0.084, p
&lt; .001)</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: The more dual credits students
accumulate, the more challenging their first-year adjustment appears to
be. Students who just barely qualify as FASt (around 12 credits) show
minimal differences, while those with substantially more credits
experience greater adjustment difficulties.</p>
<hr />
<h2
id="research-question-2-how-does-fast-status-affect-emotional-distress">Research
Question 2: How Does FASt Status Affect Emotional Distress?</h2>
<p><strong>Finding: FASt students experience more emotional distress,
and this intensifies with more credits.</strong></p>
<p>FASt status significantly increases emotional distress (a₁ = 0.21, p
&lt; .001). This means FASt students report higher levels of academic
stress, loneliness, mental health difficulties, exhaustion, sleep
problems, and financial concerns.</p>
<p>The moderation effect is also significant (a₁z = 0.17, p &lt; .001):
- <strong>Low credit dose</strong>: No significant effect on distress -
<strong>Average credit dose</strong>: Moderate increase in distress -
<strong>High credit dose</strong>: Strong increase in distress (0.43, p
&lt; .001)</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: Students who enter with more dual
credits experience substantially more emotional distress during their
first year. This may reflect the challenges of missing developmental
experiences that typically occur during the senior year of high school,
or feeling out of sync with same-age peers who are experiencing college
milestones together.</p>
<hr />
<h2
id="research-question-3-how-does-fast-status-affect-quality-of-engagement">Research
Question 3: How Does FASt Status Affect Quality of Engagement?</h2>
<p><strong>Finding: The relationship reverses depending on credit
dose.</strong></p>
<p>FASt status alone does not significantly affect quality of engagement
(a₂ = 0.04, p = .477). However, there is a strong moderation effect (a₂z
= -0.26, p &lt; .001):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low credit dose</strong>: FASt students show <em>higher</em>
engagement (0.38, p &lt; .001)</li>
<li><strong>Average credit dose</strong>: No significant difference</li>
<li><strong>High credit dose</strong>: FASt students show <em>lower</em>
engagement (-0.31, p &lt; .001)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: This is a striking crossover
interaction. Students who enter with modest dual credit experience
(around 12-15 credits) actually engage more with faculty, staff,
advisors, and peers—perhaps because they feel confident and prepared.
However, students with extensive dual credit experience (20+ credits)
engage less with the campus community, possibly because they feel
disconnected from typical first-year experiences or may be further along
in their academic trajectory.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="mediation-analysis-how-do-the-effects-work">Mediation Analysis:
How Do the Effects Work?</h2>
<p><strong>Finding: Both emotional distress and quality of engagement
mediate the effect, but in opposite directions.</strong></p>
<h3 id="emotional-distress-pathway">Emotional Distress Pathway</h3>
<ul>
<li>Distress significantly harms developmental adjustment (b₁ = -0.15, p
&lt; .001)</li>
<li>The indirect effect through distress is significant at average and
high credit levels</li>
<li><strong>Index of moderated mediation</strong>: -0.025 (p &lt; .001),
confirming that the mediation effect strengthens with more credits</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="quality-of-engagement-pathway">Quality of Engagement
Pathway</h3>
<ul>
<li>Engagement significantly helps developmental adjustment (b₂ = 0.11,
p &lt; .001)</li>
<li>The indirect effect through engagement varies by credit dose:
<ul>
<li>Low dose: Positive indirect effect (engagement helps)</li>
<li>High dose: Negative indirect effect (reduced engagement hurts)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Index of moderated mediation</strong>: -0.028 (p &lt;
.001)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="direct-effect">Direct Effect</h3>
<ul>
<li>The direct effect of FASt on adjustment (controlling for mediators)
is not significant (c = -0.02, p = .29)</li>
<li>This indicates <strong>full mediation</strong>: the effect of FASt
status operates entirely through emotional distress and quality of
engagement</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary-of-key-takeaways">Summary of Key Takeaways</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Credit dose matters more than FASt status alone.</strong>
The effects of accelerated dual credit are not uniform—students with
more credits experience greater challenges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Two competing mechanisms.</strong> FASt status increases
emotional distress (harmful) and can either increase or decrease
engagement depending on credit dose.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Full mediation.</strong> The effects of FASt status on
developmental adjustment operate entirely through these psychological
mechanisms, not through direct effects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A crossover pattern for engagement.</strong> Modest dual
credit experience appears beneficial for engagement, while extensive
experience appears detrimental.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implications for practice.</strong> Interventions should
target students with high credit loads, focusing on reducing emotional
distress and promoting meaningful campus engagement despite their
advanced academic standing.</p></li>
