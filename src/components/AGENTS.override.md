# UI / Design Edit Constraints (Override)

- Visual diffs must be limited strictly to the requested component or state.
- No design polish, consistency fixes, or refactors outside the request.
- No global CSS, theme tokens, or shared design system changes unless explicitly requested.
- If a broader design-system change seems necessary, STOP and propose it without implementing.
