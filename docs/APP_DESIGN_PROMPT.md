## Design Philosophy

### Accessible Scholarship

This platform bridges rigorous academic research and practical understanding. The goal is to communicate complex statistical findings to diverse professional stakeholders without sacrificing methodological precision or scholarly credibility.

**Guiding Principle:** Sophisticated presentation of nuanced findings. The platform should demonstrate that complex conditional process models can be communicated effectively to research-literate audiences who may not specialize in SEM.

The platform should feel like an interactive supplement to a peer-reviewed journal article — rigorous, well-documented, and intellectually engaging. Design references: New York Times Upshot, Pew Research Center, Urban Institute data tools.

## Target Audiences

**Primary Context:** Research symposium presentation and academic dissemination

| Audience | Primary Need | Engagement Mode |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Academic Researchers** | Methodological rigor, replicability, theoretical contribution | Deep dive into model specification and diagnostics |
| **Faculty & Department Chairs** | Evidence for curriculum and advising decisions | Findings summary with institutional implications |
| **Institutional Research Professionals** | Actionable data for enrollment management and student success | Subgroup analyses and effect heterogeneity |
| **Policymakers & Legislative Staff** | Executive summary for resource allocation decisions | Key findings with confidence levels |
| **Higher Education Administrators** | Implementation guidance — which students benefit, under what conditions | Practical recommendations with supporting evidence |
| **Doctoral Students & Early-Career Researchers** | Methodological exemplar for conditional process analysis | Technical appendix and code availability |

---

## Communication Guidelines

### Plain Language Standards

Research findings should be communicated in clear, accessible language while maintaining academic precision. The goal is comprehension, not condescension.

| Technical Term | Accessible Alternative |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Propensity score weighting | Comparing similar students to account for pre-existing differences |
| Mediator variable | Intermediate outcome / mechanism |
| Conditional effect at Z = +1 SD | Effect for students with above-average dual credit exposure |
| Statistically significant (p < .05) | Reliable finding (unlikely due to chance) |
| Latent construct | Composite measure derived from multiple survey items |
| Effect size (d = 0.3) | Modest but meaningful difference |
| Bootstrap confidence interval | Range of plausible values for the true effect |
| RMSEA, CFI, TLI | Model fit indicators (present in technical appendix only) |
| Moderated mediation | The mechanism varies depending on student characteristics |
| Variance explained | Proportion of differences accounted for by the model |

**Presentation Rule:** Every statistical finding should be accompanied by a contextual interpretation in plain language.

## Research Summary

### The Central Question

Does accelerated dual credit participation improve first-year college students' psychosocial adjustment — and if so, through what mechanisms and for whom?

### Key Findings

1. **Overall Effect:** Students entering with ≥12 transferable dual credits (FASt status) demonstrated better developmental adjustment outcomes
   
2. **Mechanisms Identified:** The positive effects operated through two parallel pathways:
   - Reduced emotional distress during the transition
   - Enhanced quality of engagement with institutional support systems

3. **Differential Benefits:** Effect magnitudes varied by student background, with first-generation and Pell-eligible students showing particularly strong responses

### Policy Relevance

Dual credit programs represent substantial public investment. This research provides evidence on program efficacy and identifies which student populations benefit most — critical information for equitable resource allocation.

---

## Study Context

### Methodological Framework

This study employs Conditional Process Analysis (Hayes Model 59) with propensity score overlap weighting to examine treatment effects while addressing selection bias inherent in observational dual credit data.

### Analytical Approach

| Component | Method |
|-----------|--------|
| Causal inference | Propensity score overlap weighting (PSW) |
| Structural model | Conditional process SEM with parallel mediation |
| Missing data | Full information maximum likelihood (FIML) |
| Uncertainty quantification | BCa bootstrap confidence intervals (B = 2,000) |
| Heterogeneity analysis | Multi-group SEM by demographic moderators |

## Visual Design System

### Professional Academic Aesthetic

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Typography** | Serif for headers (scholarly credibility), sans-serif for body (readability) |
| **Color Palette** | Muted, professional — navy, slate, warm gray; accent colors for statistical significance |
| **Data Visualization** | Clean axes, minimal chartjunk, APA-style formatting where applicable |
| **Whitespace** | Generous margins, clear visual hierarchy |
| **Icons** | Minimal, functional — avoid decorative elements |

### Color System

| Color | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| Navy (#1e3a5f) | Primary headers, significant effects |
| Slate (#64748b) | Secondary text, non-significant effects |
| Teal (#0d9488) | Positive effects, FASt group |
| Amber (#d97706) | Comparison group, caution indicators |
| Light Gray (#f1f5f9) | Backgrounds, confidence bands |
| White (#ffffff) | Cards, primary background |

### Data Visualization Standards

- **Confidence intervals:** Always displayed; use shaded bands or error bars
- **Effect sizes:** Include standardized coefficients with benchmarks
- **Statistical significance:** Indicated by color intensity, not asterisks alone
- **Sample sizes:** Displayed for all subgroup analyses
- **Uncertainty:** Visualized, not hidden — bootstrap distributions available on demand

### Animation Guidelines

- **Purpose-driven only:** Animation should reveal insight, not decorate
- **Subtle transitions:** Fade and ease, never bounce or overshoot
- **User-controlled:** Complex animations should be triggered, not automatic
- **Performance:** 60fps minimum, no animation on reduced-motion preference
